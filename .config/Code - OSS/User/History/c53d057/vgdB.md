## Installation

To install **Code Garden** theme, run the following command:

```sh
Hyde theme import "Code Garden" https://github.com/jacobfranco/Code-Garden
```

Alternatively, you can import the theme by running:

```sh
Hyde theme import
```

Then choose Code Garden from the options.

## Additional Customization

If you would like some additional transparency, add this in your `~/.config/kitty/kitty.conf`:

```
background_opacity 0.80
```

I'm partial to the font [**Menlo**](https://github.com/hbin/top-programming-fonts/tree/master) for the terminal, so you can include that while you're at it. I also use it for VSCode.

I also use the theme [**poimandres**](https://github.com/drcmda/poimandres-theme) for VSCode, also available for Neovim if that's more your style.
